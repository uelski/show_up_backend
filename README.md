# Show Up Application Rails-Api

This repo contains the RESTful API back-end corresponding to the Node Express app [front-end](https://github.com/uelski/show_up_frontend), making up my final General Assembly project.

The idea behind this app came from aggregating information on smaller, local and DIY shows, allowing bands to act as users, sign-up, and post upcoming events. I love playing music, and found a need for often overlooked and unheard of bands to get their info out in the open in one place.

Technologies used:
- RESTful Rails-Api
2. PostgreSQL
3. Active Record ORM
2. rack-cors gem for cross-origin AJAX calls
3. JSON Web Tokens for authentication
4. Digital Ocean deployment
